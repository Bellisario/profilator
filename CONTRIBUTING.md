# Contributing guidelines

Make sure to follow these guidelines before opening an [issue](https://github.com/Bellisario/profilator/issues/new/choose) or a [pull request](https://github.com/Bellisario/profilator/pulls):

- An issue is for a bug or a feature request, if you have any question or something similar, please use [Discussions](https://github.com/Bellisario/profilator/discussions).
- Before opening an issue of a pull request, please check if the issue or the pull request already exists.
- Before opening a pull request, make sure to run `deno fmt` and `deno lint` on the whole project to keep code style and linting rules.
- Pull requests for packages updates are not allowed since there is [Udd](https://github.com/hayd/deno-udd) that checks them automatically.
- If you don't know how to contribute, also because you don't know TypeScript, JavaScript, or Deno, you can always help others on [Discussions](https://github.com/Bellisario/profilator/discussions), debug the application, share your awesome ideas with a new issue (feature request) and check the whole project for misspellings, too.
